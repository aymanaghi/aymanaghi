# Welcome to My Digital Chaos 🌀 

**Yo, what's up?** 👾🐸 I'm Ayman (aka Stinger when I'm in the zone). This is where my tech obsessions, gaming addictions, and creative madness collide. Grab some caffeine and enjoy the ride.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

- 💻 **OS Hopper**: Constantly distro-hopping between Fedora, Kali, Mint, and whatever catches my eye
- 🎮 **Gaming Fiend**: Dota 2 addict with questionable win rates 
- 🌱 **Forever Learning**: Currently juggling [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), web dev, 3D modeling, and Python wizardry
- ☕ **Coffee-powered**: My IDE runs on caffeine (and occasional tears)

**Want to chat about:**  
→ Linux quirks  
→ Gaming fails  
→ Why Python list comprehensions are actual magic  
→ How to pretend you're productive while actually gaming
