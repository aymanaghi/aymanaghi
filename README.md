# Welcome to My Chaos

Yo, what's up? 👾 I’m Ayman (aka Stinger when I’m in my element). This is my digital lair where I let my passions for tech, gaming, and design run wild. Grab your coffee and let’s dive into the madness.

## About Me

- 💻 I'm that person who’s constantly bouncing between Linux distros (Fedora, Kali, Mint, you name it) while crushing gaming sessions. Yeah, I might have an addiction.
- 🎮 I’ve spent way too many hours on Dota 2.
- 🌱 I’m always learning. Currently into web dev, 3D modeling, and the occasional deep dive into Python.
- 📧 Reach out if you wanna chat about coding, games, or how to escape the gaming rabbit hole (spoiler: there’s no escape).

## Projects

Here’s a taste of what’s currently eating up my time:

- **Web Dev Project**: Working on a personal site that doesn’t suck. 🚀
- **Gaming Addiction Tracker**: Just kidding. But seriously, maybe I should track my hours and quit... or not. 🤔
- **3D Animation**: You bet I’m making something ridiculous with Blender.

## Final Thoughts

So yeah, that’s me. Tech nerd. Gaming addict. Linux lover. If you see me online, don't expect me to be productive — I'll probably be mid-game, chasing that next win (or fail... it’s mostly the latter).

Thanks for stopping by. Don’t be a stranger. 😎
