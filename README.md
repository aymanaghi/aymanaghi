# Welcome to My Chaos

Yo, what's up? ðŸ‘¾ Iâ€™m Ayman (aka Stinger when Iâ€™m in my element). This is my digital lair where I let my passions for tech, gaming, and design run wild. Grab your coffee and letâ€™s dive into the madness.

## About Me

- ðŸ’» I'm that person whoâ€™s constantly bouncing between Linux distros (Fedora, Kali, Mint, you name it) while crushing gaming sessions. Yeah, I might have an addiction.
- ðŸŽ® Iâ€™ve spent way too many hours on Dota 2.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning. Currently into web dev, 3D modeling, and the occasional deep dive into Python.
- ðŸ“§ Reach out if you wanna chat about coding, games, or how to escape the gaming rabbit hole (spoiler: thereâ€™s no escape).

## Projects

Hereâ€™s a taste of whatâ€™s currently eating up my time:

- **Web Dev Project**: Working on a personal site that doesnâ€™t suck. ðŸš€
- **Gaming Addiction Tracker**: Just kidding. But seriously, maybe I should track my hours and quit... or not. ðŸ¤”
- **3D Animation**: You bet Iâ€™m making something ridiculous with Blender.

## Final Thoughts

So yeah, thatâ€™s me. Tech nerd. Gaming addict. Linux lover. If you see me online, don't expect me to be productive â€” I'll probably be mid-game, chasing that next win (or fail... itâ€™s mostly the latter).

Thanks for stopping by. Donâ€™t be a stranger. ðŸ˜Ž
