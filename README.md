Yo, what's up? üëæ I‚Äôm Ayman 
![Screenshot 2025-02-19 210539](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e046f42a-bed0-4f53-826e-c9314aa2f13e)
 (aka Stinger when I‚Äôm in my element). This is my digital lair where I let my passions for tech, gaming, and design run wild. Grab your coffee and let‚Äôs dive into the madness.

## About Me

- üíª I'm that person who‚Äôs constantly bouncing between Linux distros (Fedora, Kali, Mint, you name it) while crushing gaming sessions. Yeah, I might have an addiction.
- üéÆ I‚Äôve spent way too many hours on Dota 2.
- üå± I‚Äôm always learning. Currently into web dev, 3D modeling, and the occasional deep dive into Python.
- üìß Reach out if you wanna chat about coding, games, or how to escape the gaming rabbit hole (spoiler: there‚Äôs no escape).

## Projects

Here‚Äôs a taste of what‚Äôs currently eating up my time:

- **Web Dev Project**: Working on a personal site that doesn‚Äôt suck. üöÄ
- **Gaming Addiction Tracker**: Just kidding. But seriously, maybe I should track my hours and quit... or not. ü§î
- **3D Animation**: You bet I‚Äôm making something ridiculous with Blender.

## Final Thoughts

So yeah, that‚Äôs me. Tech nerd. Gaming addict. Linux lover. If you see me online, don't expect me to be productive ‚Äî I'll probably be mid-game, chasing that next win (or fail... it‚Äôs mostly the latter).

Thanks for stopping by. Don‚Äôt be a stranger. üòé
